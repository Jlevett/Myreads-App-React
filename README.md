# MyReads Project

## About
A React application for managing books to read/already read. Similar to Goodreads.

Originally just provided with a static css, html template (no react code). The project was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring it into a usuable react front end application.

The bookshelf app allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. Users can search for books and add books to their bookshelf. Data is persisted by the udacity backend server.

Code files that were created/edited for this project include the app.css. index.js, app.js file and all js files in the components directory.


## Installation and Running
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server on port 3000.
3. Open 'http://localhost:3000/'


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md]. That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
